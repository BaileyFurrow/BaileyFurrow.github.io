Soon, I will be potentially taking on new responsibilities at my current job, as
I have shown interest in working with an IT Developer in application/update
deployment. With my extensive knowledge in PowerShell, I will excel at the role.

<!--more-->

To begin preparing, I have decided to run through [a lab kit from Microsoft
to learn more about MECM][lab-link] and how it works. Currently, I know some of
the basics that a technician would need to know to work in MECM, including
remote control access, retrieving PC information, and troubleshooting MECM
client issues. I am also familiar with other aspects of MECM, including task
sequences, the basics of the PC imaging process through PXE, viewing driver
packages, and some limited knowledge of application deployment.

Let's begin!

## Day 1

### Cloud/Account Setups

This lab requires quite a few free trials of different Azure resources,
including Microsoft 365, Azure AD (now known as Entra ID), Enterprise Mobility +
Security (which appears to be referred to as just Intune now), and Defender for
Business. I had to create three different users in Azure: LabAdmin, who has
Global Administrator privileges (not recommended in the real world, but fine for
a lab and makes lab setup a little easier); TU1, or Test User1; and TU2, or Test
User2. Each user also gets a license assigned for 365 and Intune.

These first few steps go fairly smoothly without too many issues. Problems begin
to arise when logging into the DC for the first time...

### Issues with Configuring Entra Connect

When setting up Entra Connect on the DC, the prerequesite steps complete without
issue. Only when I begin the install for Entra Connect that I begin running into
issues.

The installer takes about 5-10 minutes before it fails, giving me this error:

![Screenshot of error message: An error occurred executing Configure AAD Sync task: An error occurred while sending the request.][aad-sync-error]

A quick glance at the file tells me that each error that appears in the log file
contains the string `[ERROR]`. Using PowerShell, I can quickly view only the
lines in the log file that are related to an error:

![Screenshot of specific error lines from log file][pwsh-aad-error]

Most of this is useless...it mostly just says that creating the connector failed
without any explanation. So I did what any IT expert would do: search on
Google. I eventually found [a fairly new post in MS Learn Q&A][qa-aad-sync]
that contained the same errors that I received. Apparently, it attempts to
enable TLS 1.2 to complete the connection and fails to do so. To enable it
manually, multiple registry values need to be set:

![Registry edits to make to manually enable TLS 1.2][tls1-2-regedits]

When attempting to change the first registry key, I discovered that the .NET
Framework was *not* installed. I installed .NET Framework v4.8.1, added the
registry keys, and rebooted the DC. I uninstalled the Entra Connect client and
successfully reinstalled it! Finally!!

With that finally finished, it is almost 1am and I need to sleep. I will
continue this setup on Saturday.
